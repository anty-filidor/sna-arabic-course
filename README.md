We used the following scale for the OPI scores. If you would like to see it
another way, let me know.
 
1 | Novice Low | A1 |
2 | Novice Mid | A2 |
3 | Novice High | A3
4 | Intermediate Low | B1
5 | Intermediate Mid | B2
6 | Intermediate High | B3
7 | Advanced Low | C1
8 | Advanced Mid | C2
9 | Advanced High | C3
10 | Superior  
11 | Distinguished
 
# Here are the answers and one clarification Q:

> 1. If a participant leaves a question blank, is it better to enter a zero
or leave the cell totally blank, or do you want an "x" in all blanks (not
just in the last questions).
> a. Example: they indicate a language but do not put their level

It's best to leave the cell blank. (Customarily, SPSS allows entering "99"
for missing data; that is another option, but blank is unambiguous. "x" we
only used in the ego-network table to indicate the respondent themselves.)

From the coding document I understood the “x” to mean ‘lack of answer’ in the 
network portion only. So on the network numbers, I put an “x” if students did
not mark any answer. To indicate the respondent, I entered “self” but I can
easily go back and change these.

> 2. Question #4- Is there a group code I should associate with this group?

If all students were just one big group, this column is redundant. If they
were divided into a few subgroups (e.g. based on their level of proficiency,
class, groupwork), that information would then be useful.

I have included these group distinctions

> 3. Question #38 - "Living in a single apartment" I understand this as,
living in a single apartment all by themselves. Is this correct?

Yes. 

> 4. Question #47 - "Living with a TL-speaking person(s)" Does this mean
living with a TL speaker as an L1? Or living with a TL speaker as an L1 or
L2+?

The latter (broader) understanding, irrespective of whether they are a
speaker of the language as an L1 or Ln. 

> 5. Question #51 - "Use TL to communicate with flat mates" Some have put
"yes" here and yes on their circle. Some have put "no" here, but yes on
their circle. Should I leave it as written or enter them to match answers.
If "yes" on circle saying "Arabic with roommates", then put yes here?

Good question. Usually students will put more thought into the circles, so
if they indicated "yes" there, we'd normally carry that information over to
this question as well.

> 6. Question #79 - by "other languages" does this include the L1? Some
students assumed that and included minutes for their L1 English use. Others
assumed it meant other L2+ languages and put nothing. It's about 50/50. I've
just put the minutes in as they have written it. Sometimes they say its for
English and sometimes they do not indicate, so I suppose I need to put what
is written. If it does label it as their L1, do you want the minutes
entered?

For this question, we tend to include the L1, yes ("other" in the sense of
non-TL), so we'd write in exactly what the respondents did

> 7. Questions #93-110 - If a participant has combined categories in one pie
piece, I am just dividing that among their combined categories. 
> a. Example: one section of 35% contains "friends, roommates,
classmates-Arabic" I'm dividing 35/2 because there is no category for
roommates, and so I am just splitting that in half and giving 17.5 each to
friends and classmates. Right?

Originally, we treated the category "friends" as including roommates, so it
can be divided the way you did. Alternatively because of the special
composition of this cohort and the living arrangements, if "roommates" tend
to come up over and over, they might be treated as an independent category.
In what percentage of the questionnaires do they appear, roughly?

In survey 1 in appeared in 8/41 surveys. 

> 8. Questions #111 - 126 - several students have not entered any minutes
for the circle's interactions, they have only drawn proportions. Are there
"average" minutes we should use if this is blank?

It's not easy to infer that information, so we leave it blank (though they
could be imputed by the data analysis team later).

> 9. Question #130 - participants have put many different numbers for
themselves. How should I code that?

Could you give an example, please (e.g., a photo with the relevant example
marked)? That would make things more tangible.
I’ve included a photo of #19’s response of interaction with himself.
